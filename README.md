# Hotel-management-System
My first C++ project, 'Hotel Management System' is a project which teaches the basics of C++ such as I/O, class &amp; objects, etc.
In this program you have two classes: customer and hotel.
In the customer class, you have variables and methods related to customer, such as name, address, booking ID, start date & end date, etc.
In the hotel class, you have variables and methods related to the hotel, such as the quantity of food items, room booking, billin, etc.
This is a beginner level program which I will refine and make efficient.
